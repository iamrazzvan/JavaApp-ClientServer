# JavaApp-ClientServer

I developed a Java application for the organizers of a motorcycle competition, which helps them manage the registration of participants in various races around the world.

Technologies used:
  - Java (+ JavaFX for the frontend)
  - SQLite database

P.S. I am going to develop this application in C# as well.
